A final project for FEWD Section 4 General Assembly SF

A quick, easy, and free bookmarklet to convert a Tweet into properly formatted MLA and APA citations.

Special thanks to the General Assembly SF community for helping me when I needed it. I also want to thank Kyle Fox for the jQuery Modal library that he developed, and I used for my modals.
